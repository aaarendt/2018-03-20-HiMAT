## Logistics 

### Travel
[Alaska Airlines](http://alaskaair.com/) has 4 non-stop flights per day from Seattle to Juneau, and is currently the only airline serving Juneau that time of year. We will assist in providing taxi service for our Chinese colleagues to get from the Juneau airport to downtown. US researchers will be expected to pay for their own transportation via taxi or public transport to get downtown.
