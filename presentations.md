### Purpose

The purpose of the talks is to share information that you believe is relevant *to the entire group*. As you prepare talks ask "Does everyone need to hear this, or is this a detail that would best be addressed in a smaller breakout group?". 

### Format
 
* each PI team will have 20 minutes to present. You can use the time as you wish (presentation, discussion, question period)
* the PI or someone else representing the group can be the presenter. Multiple presenters are fine as long as the flow of information is well organized.

### Content 

* quickly remind us what key science questions, ideally drawn from our existing Science Tracability Matrix, your group is working on. Keep this section short! We already mostly know what each other team is doing.
* tell us what advances you have made since our last time together. 
* provide a list of things you need from other teams. Are you waiting on anything? Just state the facts without assigning blame. Our goal is to identify potential bottlenecks and work these out during the meeting.
* do you have anything new to provide to the team that they didn't know about before? For example a dataset, new algorithm, or new insight? Map these out and provide specific information about how people can follow up with you later.
* for your final slide: make a general list of your existing and and planned cross-team collaboration. If collaborations are not occurring, list those you would like to see started or reignited.
