# Day 2: Wednesday March 21

On day 2 we will leave space for breakout teams. Our thinking is that connections and collaborations across the team are already well defined, and that people will be able to quickly form groups to dive deeper on specific details.

We need to define the breakout groups in advance of the meeting. These are ideas, to be refined as we approach the event:

* **precipitation** progress on 3 papers; downscaling efforts, statistical validation
* **glaciers** what are the land surface models showing? How to refine and improve glacier simulations, especially how to handle geometry adjustments in future simulations? Discuss latest Huss and Hock paper.
* **ground observations** working through details of which stations are ordered/to be ordered, how to share the data, who to contact  
* **computing** Is ADAPT serving our needs? Some teams want to explore deploying WRF in commercial cloud: should we try this? Can we shift some of our data sharing to AWS? 
* **snow** 
* **climate modeling**
* **land surface modeling**
* **GLOFs**
* **remote sensing validation**
* **hazards**
* **impacts**
